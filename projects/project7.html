            <h2>&nbsp;Process & Challenges</h2>
            <p class="details"><br>I decided to do a magazine cover for Keshi - an artist who recently made an album
                after a two year haitus. I like his music and I knew he would fit well in a magazine cover.
                Before doing the actual magazine cover for Keshi, I had to identify the main components of a magazine
                cover so I took a sample of one and started anaylyzing it.
                I took an image from the artist's Instagram account and remove its background using Adobe PhotoShop and
                added a solid background colour that is somewhat neutral in order to not take away the spotlight from
                the main subject, using Adobe InDesign.
                I also added a drop shadow to the artist as an extra step and I think it fits well with the direction of
                the light from the picture itself.
                <br><br>The challenging part of this project is probably thinking about the name of the magazine and the
                limited space I had to fit all the info that I wanted to put in the cover.
                I had to take into account the appropriate font size, colour and placement of each text components
                strategically rather than just randomly placing them in the magazine layout.

            <h2>&nbsp;Solution & Outcome</h2>
            <p class="details"><br> I settled with the name "SOULWAVE" as Keshi's his music genre mostly revolves around
                having the soul vibe.
                In order to aligned my texts and graphics properly, I resorted to using InDesign for the grids and
                margins.
                I found a good way of balancing the information that I wanted to include in the magazine cover.
                I mainly chose red and white as the main colours and I chose the appropriate font size while respecting
                the grids and margins of the layout.
                I did want to include the artist's name somewhere and I decided to put it in the middle of the artist's
                name with a black background and this background is important because it highlights
                the name of the subject and making it stand out more. Additionally, his hands are also in the golden
                ratio, making it visually pleasing to the eyes, while also emphasizing his hands position - they put
                importance on his abilities to use musical instruments.
