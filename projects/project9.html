                <p class="details"><br>
                    For this part of the project, we were asked to create a short logo animation of a brand that we created.
                    The idea is to bring the logo/brand to life and to convey the brand's message by making dynamic and engaging animation.

            <h2>&nbsp;Process & Challenges</h2>
            <p class="details"><br>  
                For the brand "Munchy Express" that I created, its logo has a drone graphic as well as the name of the company.
                I had to plan which parts of the logo were moving and in what way/direction. I first used Adobe Illustrator to create the logo and I created another file from the same app to carefully layer the elements that will be used for the animation.
                Finally, I exported the file to Adobe After Effects to start animating. 
                <br><br>The challenges lie on making a smooth transition in the animation and the use of sound effects. 
                Overall there were techniques that were needed to use in order to achieve my goal on
                making a smooth 5 second animation video.           
            </p><br>

            <h2>&nbsp;Solution & Outcome</h2>
            <p class="details"><br>
                I explored the types of animations that can be used to familiarize myself with After Effects and after playing around for a bit of time,
                I decided for the drone's wings to rotate while it is moving from left to right until it reached the first word "MUNCHY". 
                At the same time, the drone itself is blinking to add a dynamic effect. For a more dramatic effect, 
                I made the other word "EXPRESS" swiftly pop out from the left side to hit the drone and do its fast transitions. 
                Ultimately it goes on top of the two words. This part of the animation gives the impression that the service of Munchy Express is truly realiable and fast.
                The animation starts quietly and at the moment of impact, sound effects can be heard and at the very last second, all the graphic elements fades to black from top to bottom.
