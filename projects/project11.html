                    I had to pick a subject to based on, and I decided to choose our lovely campus - Vanier College.
                    Aside from drawing the art, I also had to use HTML and CSS to start animating it.</p>

            <p class="details"><br>I basically had to look at Google Maps to get the specific angle that I want to
                illustrate and I started from there.
                <br><br>Vanier College is a big campus with lots of big trees and windows so I knew that illustrating
                those
                would be a big challenge for me
                in terms of testing my patience and overall skills.

            <h2>&nbsp;Solution & Outcome</h2>
            <p class="details"><br>
                To solve the problem of Vanier having so many trees and windows, I did not draw
                every tree that existed in that campus and I made it in a season where the tree leaves are dead
                (Fall-Winter)
                As for the windows, I decided to make copies of the same initial windows that were drawn and made slight
                changes to make them different. I also added gradients and shadows to make the art more interesting.
                After a few hours of concentrating and lots of crashing and lagging later, I finished and it was time to
                animate the art. <br><br>
                I exported the Illustrator file into SVG and started working on VS Code. In terms of the actual
                animation, I
                made the branch in front to slighty move up and down, I played around with the opacity of the sky and
                the
                shadow to make it look like a transition between daytime to night.
                The stars are also blinking in the sky.
