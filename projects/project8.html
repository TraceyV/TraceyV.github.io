                    This was event that gave people the opportunity to sell illustrations and design pieces called What
                    the Pop!, organized by YES Montreal.
                    The goal is to help artists and designers gain visibility and monetize their art if chosen.

            <h2>&nbsp;Process & Challenges</h2>
            <p class="details"><br>
                This was an event that one of our teachers mentioned to everyone around Summer of 2024, and I was
                interested in joining because I had nothing to lose.
                I asked one of my friends to tag along as it would be a great opportunity for the both of us as we are
                both graphic designers.
                We decided that we want to create a gym apparel wear that uses various animals as its mascot.
                We settle for the brand's name to be "CHAKRA" and this name was chosen because we wanted people to be
                reminded of energy when working out and using the clothes.
                My friend and I decdied to plan on doing 5 different graphics each related to the theme.
                <br><br>The challenge of this project is making 5 different graphics and their mock-ups under 2 weeks so
                that we had something to show to the event organizers before the registration site closed.
                My friend and I were also doing things like our part-time job as it was Summer so we had to find the
                time to make those graphics whenever we can and it was not always easy as we were sometimes too
                exhausted to even think about drawing.

            <h2>&nbsp;Solution & Outcome</h2>
            <p class="details"><br>
                Fueled with our desire to be a part of such a great opportunity, we finished the graphics and the
                necessary mock-ups before the deadlines, therefore, we were able to register in time and submit our
                product.
                I would communicate with my friend often to update my progress, we would motivate each other to finish.
                Unfortunately, we were not one of the lucky winners that were chosen to be a part of the event but we
                were proud of ourselves for trying and getting something done in time.
                Overall, I liked the outcome of the project and we took the defeat as a learning opportunity and we were
                not too saddened by the lost.
                <br>The following images are the outcome of my own work and to save space, the said images are just a
                few of the many mockups done.
